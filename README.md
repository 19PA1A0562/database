## chatbot with datastore
The Homepage consists of brief introduction about the quiz .After clicking on the start button .The user should register if user is new to the website or else the user can directly login to attempt the quiz. The user details stored in the form of table .We used SQlite to store the user infromation while registration.
The bot starts with a welcome message.
The bot will ask 10 random questions from the topic you have selected.
After answering all the questions the bot will show the result of the quiz that the user attempted.
If he want to continue the quiz the process again begins by selecting the topic.
Most of us want to learn new thing but to search them in the websites and reading the matter is not much intresting.
So we decided to have a chatterbot that will provide quiz and you can find the answers at the end of the quiz you can get the knowledge with encouragement.

## Process to use the chatterbot
1. Bot will starts with a welcome message.
2. Bot will ask to enter the quiz to start the quiz.
3. After entering the quiz the topics will display.
4. Select the topic number.
5. Now random 10 questions will be given.
6. At the end the wrong answers with the score will be given.
