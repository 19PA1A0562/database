## About chatterbot
The bot will ask 10 random questions from the topic you have selected.
Most of us want to learn new thing but to search them in the websites and reading the matter is not much intresting.
So we decided to have a chatterbot that will provide quiz and you can find the answers at the end of the quiz you can get the knowledge with encouragement.

## Process to use the chatterbot
1. Bot will ask the name and store the name in json format
2. Bot will ask to enter the quiz to start the quiz.
3. After entering the quiz the topics will display.
4. Select the topic number.
5. Now random 10 questions will be given.
6. At the end the wrong answers with the score will be given.
